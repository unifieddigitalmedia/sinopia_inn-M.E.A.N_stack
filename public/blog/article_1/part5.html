Stepping out of Sinopia Inn into its natural environment was great. The cool green hills formed a dramatic backdrop to the historic architecture of the parish’s residential homes and town buildings. The vast amount of greenery accelerated by the rain cooled the parish in the day time and made my trip even more attractive.

<p> 


Not only did this cool scenic route remind me of the challenge of the air pollution we’re facing in our major cities but it also left me appreciative of this breath of fresh air - and also of the tremendous wealth to be gained by sustainable and self-sufficient living. All food produce served at Sinopia Inn was  sourced locally, offering fresh and seasonal dishes that tasted great. I have no doubt that this was due to Portland’s soil and heavy rains that were well suited to organic cultivation.

<p> 


So I asked for a tour of the farm hoping to get a few tip / tricks to take back to my urban dwelling and was astounded to see 10 acres of farm land filled with an array of fruits and ground provisions plus a few chickens. Immediately I knew that Sinopia Inn definitely showed signs of future promise. It may seem a long way off but the community benefits may drive sustainable farming with a little help.
