        <div class="panel-body">


We need your information so that we can, in accordance with the contract you have with us, provide you with content, products, services, tailored and personalised recommendations, general account management, and the management of traffic across our network. In addition to using your information for such purposes, we may also use your information in the following ways:

To monitor, improve and protect our content, products and services, work with our agents and business partners to improve the products and services we offer, and develop new content, products and services.
We may share information with credit reference, fraud prevention agencies, entities in which we hold a share of the ownership and other companies for use in credit decisions, for fraud detection and debt recovery purposes.
We may transfer your information to our data processors outside the European Economic Area, but will do so with appropriate measures and controls in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations and regulatory guidance. In all instances, we will take into account the nature of the information we are transferring, and the level of protection provided by those processors.
If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, the details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We, our shared ownership group entities and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities; managing credit and credit related accounts and facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance or other types of financial services; or checking details of job applications and employees. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. Please contact us if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.
For market research.
To enable us to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements; to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party; in the detection and prevention of fraud and other crimes; and for the purpose of safeguarding someone’s vital interests, national security, responding to statutory obligations or requests from the courts and enforcement authorities.
We may disclose your information to any successors of our business for them to use for the purposes set out in this privacy notice.


Unless you've asked us not to:

To send you periodic newsletters and other information about content, products and services you have chosen or are entitled to receive.
To send you direct marketing. This may include communications by post, telephone, SMS or email, about us and our business partners’ content, products and services, events and special offers, including, where applicable, for a reasonable time after you have ceased to be a customer of ours.
To provide you with more relevant tailored advertising. Sky can serve different ads to groups of different Sky households watching the same programme. We use the information we hold about you and your household, to make some of the adverts you see and the offers you receive more relevant. This is done using a process that helps to make sure that advertising plays out when a chosen audience of types of households is most likely to be watching. We retain your information in accordance with our group data retention and deletion policies. These set out the criteria we use to determine how long we keep information, what measures we put in place to keep your information safe and secure, and with whom we may share your information. When deciding what to retain, we take into account what information we need to best provide you with products, goods and services, manage your relationship with us and meet our statutory obligations.

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to the devices you use to receive Sky content, products and services and access online information.

        <div class="panel-body">




Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using devices and accessing online information much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups.

Cookies that are needed to provide the content, product or service you have asked for

Some cookies are essential to help your devices download or stream the information, or so you can move around websites and use their features. Without these cookies, content, products or services you've asked for can't be provided. 

Here are some examples of essential cookies:

Positioning information on a smartphone screen, tablet device or other screen so that you can see the website and use its functionality.
Keeping you logged in during your visit or enabling you to stream content; without cookies you might have to log in on every website you visit or repeatedly adjust your volume and viewing settings.
When you add something to the online shopping basket, cookies make sure it's still there when you get to the checkout.
Some are session cookies which make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly.
Improving your browsing experience

Cookies allow the application or website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features. 

Here are a few examples of just some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our applications and websites:

Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences, such as choosing whether you wish to receive marketing information.
Remembering if you've filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.
Remembering if you've been to the application or website before.
Restricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.
Showing you information that's relevant to content, products or services that you receive.
Giving you access to content provided by social-media sites like Facebook or Twitter.
Showing 'related article' links that are relevant to the information you're looking at.
Remembering an application or website you've entered, such as weather forecasts.
Analytics

We like to keep track of what websites, information and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much, to help us keep our information relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our information and when and where 'error messages' may originate.

This group of cookies, often called 'analytics cookies' are used to gather this information. The information collected is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies are used to improve how an application, a website and its pages work.

Our applications, web locations, websites and communications you get from us contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or ' pixels'. These are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of the communication.

Affiliate cookies

We use 'affiliate' cookies. Some of our web based information will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the Internet Advertising Bureau's guide about how affiliate marketing works.

      </div>


  <div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse ">
        <div class="panel-body">



We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser uses the browsing information collected from these cookies to:

restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping) and
help show other advertisements that are relevant to you while you're accessing our information. This information about your browsing activity may be grouped with information about what is being accessed by other users, into interest groups, and then used to show you advertisements based on those interests. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests.
Sometimes our websites contain advertisements for our own Sky products. These advertisements use cookies in the same way as described above.

        <div class="panel-body">

How can I see and manage my cookies in my browser?

Virtually all modern browsers allow you to see what cookies you've got, and to clear them individually or clear all of them. To find out how to do this go aboutcookies.org, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.

How can I choose not to receive Online Behavioural Advertising and other tracking cookies?

In addition to the controls available on your computer, there are other ways of choosing not to receive Online Behavioural Advertising and other tracking cookies.

Please note that most of these choices work by setting a cookie that overrides the behavioural advertising cookie. If you clear all your cookies, you will also clear these opt-out cookies, therefore changing your preferences. In this instance you would need to choose again.

Organisations which provide more information on Online Behavioural Advertising

Evidon are a provider of privacy solutions.
